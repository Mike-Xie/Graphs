""" UPER 
Use the room and player APIs to traverse the entire maze
Have to construct the graph as we walk around in the
form:
{ 
room_id : {'n': '?', 's': '?', 'w': '?', 'e': '?'}
}

Player methods:
player.travel(direction key) to travel to valid room
player.current_room.id to get the current room's id

Room get methods methods:
exits with room.get_exits()
coordinates with room.get_coords()
the name of a next room with room.get_room_in_direction(direction)

So then we start in room zero like this:
Room_0: {'n': '?', 's': '?', 'w': '?', 'e': '?'}

And we add this to the list of explored rooms:

explored_rooms: List[Room] = []

Also we need the return list of directions:

directions: List[str] = []

We start by checking exits with room.get_exits() and updating the ?s to 
which rooms they link to with get_room_in_direction(direction) . . . this is
too much work/confusing maybe do later if bored

Also checking that we haven't been there already with something like:

room.get_room_in_direction(direction) in explored_rooms == False

and then we go into a random valid next room and repeating this until we can
no longer do this and are at a dead end.

SAVE THE DIRECTIONS WE WENT IN ORDER SO CAN REVERSE WHEN WE REACH A DEAD END, I guess we can do this and the room together
and use whatever is the opposite of zip to seperate into a list of room sequences and direction sequences later

Then we back out until we can go to a new room.

So something like:

initialize traversal_path, rooms graph, starting room

DFT standard boiler plate code using a stack

stack.push(starting room, NONE)
graph = {}

while stack.size > 0:
    curr = s.PEEK() otherwise it is unable to reverse since it'll have done 2 pops and only 1 push
    add room to graph, add direction to list
    if curr not in graph:
        graph add curr
    if we moved somewhere:
        add direction to traversal_path
    if len(graph) == len(room_graph)
        break

    if able to go somewhere NEW, depth first search in random direction
        adding to graph and traversal_path
    else reverse until can go somewhere new
        adding to traversal_path
        pop where we were
    then when this else ends we go back up to the start of the while and DFS again
